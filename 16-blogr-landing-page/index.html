    Designed for the future <br />

    Introducing an extensible editor <br />
    Blogr features an exceedingly intuitive interface which lets you focus on
    one thing: creating content. The editor supports management of multiple
    blogs and allows easy manipulation of embeds such as images, videos, and
    Markdown. Extensibility with plugins and themes provide easy ways to add
    functionality or change the looks of a blog. <br />

    Robust content management <br />
    Flexible content management enables users to easily move through posts.
    Increase the usability of your blog by adding customized categories,
    sections, format, or flow. With this functionality, youâ€™re in full control.
    <br />

    State of the Art Infrastructure <br />
    With reliability and speed in mind, worldwide data centers provide the
    backbone for ultra-fast connectivity. This ensures your site will load
    instantly, no matter where your readers are, keeping your site competitive.
    <br />

    Free, open, simple <br />

    helpful developers. It supports features such as code syntax highlighting,
    RSS feeds, social media integration, third-party commenting tools, and works
    seamlessly with Google Analytics. The architecture is clean and is
    relatively easy to learn. <br />

    Powerful tooling <br />
    Batteries included. We built a simple and straightforward CLI tool that
    makes customization and deployment a breeze, but capable of producing even
    the most complicated sites. <br />
