    Designed for the future <br />

    Introducing an extensible editor <br />
    Blogr features an exceedingly intuitive interface which lets you focus on
    one thing: creating content. The editor supports management of multiple
    blogs and allows easy manipulation of embeds such as images, videos, and
    Markdown. Extensibility with plugins and themes provide easy ways to add
    functionality or change the looks of a blog. <br />

    Robust content management <br />
    Flexible content management enables users to easily move through posts.
    Increase the usability of your blog by adding customized categories,
    sections, format, or flow. With this functionality, youâ€™re in full control.
    <br />

    State of the Art Infrastructure <br />
    With reliability and speed in mind, worldwide data centers provide the
    backbone for ultra-fast connectivity. This ensures your site will load
    instantly, no matter where your readers are, keeping your site competitive.
    <br />

    relatively easy to learn. <br />
